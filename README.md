# AWANink ONE SOL Website Blueprint

This workspace scaffolds two tailored versions of the AWANink website experience:

- **Tech-Forward Executive** (`tech.html`): jargon-rich narrative optimized for high-growth founders and CTOs.
- **Practical Entrepreneur** (`practical.html`): plain-language storytelling for busy owners focused on cash flow.

Shared assets include a savings calculator module (`js/calculator.js`) and core styling (`css/base.css`).

Next steps:
1. Flesh out each version's copy blocks per the provided blueprint.
2. Implement the interactive ONE SOL savings calculator and ROI dashboards.
3. Expand industry-specific pages and integrate with social funnel workflows.
